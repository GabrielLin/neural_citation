# Deep citation recommendation
An implementation of a deep learning model for citation recommendation.

## To-Dos
1. Start preparing presentation [TeX or PowerPoint]?
2. Get original code to work with author's data
3. Reimplement the author's code in torch
4. Modify code, change original code hyperparameters
5. Extend model to work with other dataset [unarxiv? MAG?] 

## Questions
* Rework initial paper draft  
    Would need to set up SQL database and preprocess data from scratch for reimplementation
    What to do?!
* Which format for the written paper?
* Which language to use?
* Can we submit later due to Timo holiday in august?
* Presentation outline  
    How important is explaining the model? (eg.g. start from scratch: What is a CNN...)  
    How important is explaining our approach and what we want to do? (e.g. What we do to improve the model)  
    How important is explaining the parameters? (e.g. embedding dimensions etc.)
